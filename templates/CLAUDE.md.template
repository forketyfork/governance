## Governance

This project is a Land in the federated governance framework. The constitution of the Federation is defined in the [CONSTITUTION.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forketyfork/governance/refs/heads/main/CONSTITUTION.md).

## Project Documentation

Read these before making any changes:

- `docs/PRD.md` — What the software does (features, user flows, success criteria)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — How it's built (layers, modules, dependencies, ADRs)
- `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` — Coding patterns for this project
- `docs/TRACEABILITY.md` — Feature-to-test mapping

## Agent Rules

1. Read the project documentation listed above before writing any code.
2. Follow `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` exactly. Do not introduce new patterns.
3. Every new public function must have a doc comment explaining WHAT it does.
4. Every new feature must have corresponding tests.
5. Do not introduce new dependencies without asking first.
6. Do not leave TODOs in code. If something is incomplete, say so.
7. If you change the architecture (new modules, new data flows), update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
8. If you add a feature, update `docs/TRACEABILITY.md`.
9. Maximum file length: 300 lines. Maximum function length: 50 lines.
10. Use conventional commit messages.

## Observability

### What the agent can do independently

- [e.g., Run tests and see output: `zig build test`]
- [e.g., Start the service: `./gradlew run`, hit endpoints: `curl localhost:8080/health`]
- [e.g., Read logs: `tail -f logs/app.log`]
- [e.g., Boot the app and inspect UI via DOM snapshots]

### What requires developer assistance

- [e.g., Obsidian plugin UI — developer must describe visual state or provide screenshot]
- [e.g., Mobile app — no remote access, developer provides screen recordings]

### Debug mode

- [e.g., `DEBUG=true npm start` enables verbose logging]
- [e.g., `zig build -Dlog-level=debug test` for debug output]

## Project-Specific Notes

[Add anything the agent needs to know that's specific to this project: quirks, known issues, special build steps, environment setup, etc.]
