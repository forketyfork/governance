## Project Documentation

Read these before making any changes:

- `docs/PRD.md` — What the software does (features, user flows, success criteria)

- `docs/TRACEABILITY.md` — Feature-to-test mapping

## Agent Rules

1. Read the project documentation listed above before writing any code.
2. Follow `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` exactly. Do not introduce new patterns.
3. Every new public function must have a doc comment explaining WHAT it does.
4. Every new feature must have corresponding tests.
5. Do not introduce new dependencies without asking first.
6. Do not leave TODOs in code. If something is incomplete, say so.
7. If you change the architecture (new modules, new data flows), update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
8. If you add a feature, update `docs/TRACEABILITY.md`.
9. Maximum file length: 300 lines. Maximum function length: 50 lines.
10. Use conventional commit messages.
